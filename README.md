## Overview

- One or more philosophers sit at a round table.
There is a large bowl of spaghetti in the middle of the table.

- The philosophers alternatively eat, think, or sleep.
While they are eating, they are not thinking nor sleeping;
while thinking, they are not eating nor sleeping;
and, of course, while sleeping, they are not eating nor thinking.

- There are also forks on the table. There are as many forks as philosophers.

- Because serving and eating spaghetti with only one fork is very inconvenient, a
philosopher takes their right and their left forks to eat, one in each hand.

- When a philosopher has finished eating, they put their forks back on the table and
start sleeping. Once awake, they start thinking again. The simulation stops when
a philosopher dies of starvation.

- Every philosopher needs to eat and should never starve.

- Philosophers don’t speak with each other.

- Philosophers don’t know if another philosopher is about to die.

- No need to say that philosophers should avoid dying!
